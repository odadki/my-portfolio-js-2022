              <p>
                There is a lack of user-friendly cooking content and recipes for
                kids and teenagers to use. Food websites and apps currently on
                the market have long, wordy content where users have to dig to
                get information on groceries, “how-to” videos and info on
                allergens.

                and more.

                Carrots is an app focusing on providing healthy & easy recipes
                for kids. The app and web-browser also provide a one-stop hub
                for access to all things cooking: grocery list, cooking tips,
                videos and more to make it convenient for kids to prep and cook
                in an organized manner. Carrots’ primary user include kids aged
                from 10+, who enjoy cooking individually or with a parent.

              I used Carrots’ data on cooking apps and observations gained from
              my competitive audit to develop interview questions. During the
              user interviews, most participants were frustrated with the lack
              of user-friendly sites that kids could use; they didn’t want a
              food service to just deliver pre-made meals, but wanted their kids
              to be able to learn to cook and have fun doing so. Their feedback
              of wanting simple features surrounding all aspects of cooking made
              it clear what Carrots’ content and design would aim for.

          <p>
            I used a quick ideation process to sketch ideas for a dedicated
            mobile app. My focus was kept on creating a simple app, while
            keeping in mind all the features (and lack thereof) from the
            competitive audit to include in the design.
